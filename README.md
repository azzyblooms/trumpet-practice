# trumpet-practice
sorry if this is messy, its my first project

IMPORTANT! FOR DETATCHED KEYBOARD ONLY! Laptop functionality will be added at a later date.

GENERAL INFO

This program attempts to simulate a real trumpet using your keyboard, using the actual fingering for each note (although some alternate fingerings may not work)
Since you can't blow into your keyboard to control the pitch (I mean, I hope you can't!), your left hand will control the register you play in. As clunky as it feels, this seems to be the best solution.

HOW TO USE

- Take your keyboard, turn it 90 degrees clockwise, and place the end at your chin or mouth. Your right index, middle, and ring fingers should rest on the P, O, and I keys respectively. Your left index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers should rest on the V, C, X, and Z keys. Both thumbs should be under the keyboard to provide support.
- Use one of the left-hand keys (Z, X, C, V, B) to play a note. The note that plays depends on which buttons are down and left-hand key you pressed.

CONTROLS

P - 1st button

O - 2nd button

I - 3rd button



Z - 1st register (low F# to C)

X - 2nd register (C# to G)

C - 3rd register (G# to high C)

V - 4th register (high C# to high E)

B - 5th register (high F to high G)
